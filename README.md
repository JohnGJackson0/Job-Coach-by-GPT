## Introduction

This documentation provides an overview of our software solution, specifically designed for software engineers (SWE). Please note that the current version of the software is not yet production-ready and requires SWE professionals to manually input job descriptions and qualifications within the code. The software employs a tailored approach to generate resumes by rewriting prompts for curated ATS (Applicant Tracking System) and customizing them to match specific skill sets.

## Overview

Our software simplifies the process of resume creation for SWE professionals by leveraging tailored prompts and adapting them to meet the requirements of curated ATS. By inputting job descriptions and qualifications into the code, users can generate customized resumes that effectively highlight their skills and qualifications in a format optimized for applicant screening by ATS.

## Key Features

1. Job Description Integration: Users can input job descriptions into the software, providing a clear understanding of the specific skill sets and qualifications sought by employers. The software then utilizes this information to rewrite prompts that resonate with curated ATS and enhance the resume's chances of passing initial screening stages.

2. Customized Prompt Generation: The software generates customized prompts based on the job description, ensuring that the resume is tailored to the specific requirements of the role. By aligning the prompts with the desired skill sets, the resulting resumes effectively showcase the user's qualifications.

3. Tailored Resume Creation: Users can modify the qualifications directly within the code to match their own expertise and experience. By adapting the prompts, the software generates resumes that accurately reflect the user's skill sets, achievements, and background, thereby increasing their chances of being noticed by potential employers.

4. Optimization for Applicant Tracking Systems: The software is designed to optimize resumes for curated ATS, which are commonly used by employers to manage large volumes of job applications.
